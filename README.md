# CA--Website

## Objective:
The web application's primary objective is to create a dynamic platform for a college Computer Association.
My main aim was to create a website that not only tells details about the association but also allows user
engagement. From providing a simple user registration process to curating a visually captivating display of
memories through images and a bit info about the image, the application aims to deliver an enriched
experience. The "About" page, designed to be more than a mere informational section, unfolds the
association's mission, membership culture, vibrant activities, and the energetic leadership team. It endeavors
to be a comprehensive and engaging digital haven for the association and its members.

## Technologies used and Why:
1. Eclipse IDE: I’ve used Eclipse IDE for the development of my dynamic web project.
2. Xampp: Using Xampp to create and deploy my database through localhost
3. JavaServer Pages (JSP): I employed JSP for server-side scripting, enabling dynamic generation of
web pages. I have used JSP for form validation and confirmation of submission.
4. HTML5 and CSS: I utilized HTML5 and CSS for structuring and styling the web pages.
5. Servlet: I have used Servlet to make the JDBC connection to MySQL and send data to my database
table “user_images”.
6. JavaScript: JavaScript was implemented for interactive features, such as a responsive navigation
menu with toggle functionality.
7. Java Database Connectivity (JDBC): I used JDBC to connect to a MySQL database, facilitating the
retrieval and display of user-uploaded images and comments.

## Application:
The website has various potential applications:
Information Hub: Centralized information about the Computer Association, catering to both current and
prospective members.
User Registration: Enables easy membership sign-up and management.
Memories Showcase: Platform for members to share memorable moments through images and comments.
Communication Center: Convenient hub for association-related announcements and updates.
Event Promotion: Promotes upcoming events, workshops, and activities organized by the association.
These applications collectively enhance the online presence, community engagement, and information
exchange within the Computer Association.
